Hi, my name is @Koustav De.
The calculator project available on my GitHub repository is a practical demonstration of my understanding and application of Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) to develop a functional and user-friendly desktop application. 
Java AWT is a fundamental toolkit for building window-based applications, and I utilized it to create a simple yet effective calculator capable of handling basic arithmetic operations.
To run the application you just need to download the Calculator.jar file.
Thank You!!
